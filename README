RUNNING AN EXTENSION IN FIREFOX

To install a Firefox extension, create a ~/Profiles directory, a directory for a new profile ("helloworld-dev") and extension subdirectory.

Add a file with the path to the extension inside the ~/Profiles/helloworld-dev/extension directory.

Name the file the same name as the extension ("ian@gardiner" - This name can be found in the chrome/content/browser.xul file).

Launch firefox: (arch -i386) /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin -profile ~/Profiles/helloworld-dev/
		/usr/bin/firefox -no-remote -profile ~/Profiles/NewsSleuth-dev

You need to have the environment variable MOZ_NO_REMOTE=1 in order to use two profiles at the same time, or else run firefox with the 
-no-remote flag.

To be able to use all the features of the extension, do the following in Firefox:

Enter about:config in the address bar, and click 'yes I'm sure'

Set these variables to true:
	extensions.logging.enabled
	javascript.options.ShowInConsole
	browser.dom.window.dump.enabled

The last one you will have to create.
